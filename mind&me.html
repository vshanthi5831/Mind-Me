            Mental health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being that affects how we think, feel, and act. It influences our ability to handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions. Maintaining good mental health is essential for leading a balanced and fulfilling life.

Mental health issues can affect anyone, regardless of age, background, or circumstances. Common conditions include anxiety disorders, depression, and stress-related disorders. It's important to recognize that mental health challenges are not a sign of weakness; they are medical conditions that require attention and care.
